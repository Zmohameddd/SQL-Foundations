# SQL Foundations Final Project

## Project Introduction

I've delved into three datasets from the City of Chicago. This exercise aimed to figure out valuable insights from these datasets, showcasing my progression in SQL.

## Objective

The core aim of this notebook is to display my acquired skills in data integration and analysis within the framework of a SQLite database. So, this project really shows how I've improved and how well I can handle SQL.

## Data Explored

In this project, I explored three distinctive datasets:

- **Socioeconomic Indicators (2008-2012):** This data let me study how people in Chicago interact socially and showed me what the living conditions are like for its residents.
- **Chicago Public Schools (2011-2012):** Studying this data helped us understand how well students are doing in school and what problems the education system is facing.
- **Chicago Crime Data:** Since 2001, this data has been used to study how crime has changed over time in Chicago, focusing on incidents that didn't result in death.

## Discoveries and Takeaways

Working with these sets of data was eye-opening, showing the detailed story within the city's information on its economy, education, and crime. This project wasn't just about technology but also provided a deep understanding of the complicated aspects of Chicago.

## Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thank you to IBM for providing the datasets and resources. Their support was instrumental in making this in-depth SQL exploration possible and immensely rewarding.
